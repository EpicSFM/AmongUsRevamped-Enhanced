  <i>A powerful host-only enhancement for Among Us – now with full <b>role pre-assignment</b> for ultimate lobby control!</i>
</p>

## 🔥 What's New in This Enhanced Version?
This is an **independent modification** of the original AmongUsRevamped, focused on adding advanced **role pre-assignment** features while keeping everything else smooth and compatible.

### ⭐ Brand New: Role Pre-Assignment System (v2.0.0)
Take full control of role distribution before the game starts!

- **/role <Color> <RoleName>** → Pre-assign a specific role to a player by their color (e.g., `/role Red Shapeshifter`).
- **/roles** → List all current pre-assignments (shows player names/colors and their assigned roles – local view only).
- **/unrole <PlayerName>** → Remove pre-assignment for a specific player.
- **/unrole** (no args) → Clear **all** pre-assignments at once.

**Smart & Balanced Behavior:**
- Respects your current game settings (e.g., if 2 Impostors + 1 Shapeshifter + 1 Phantom are enabled → no duplicates allowed).
- If a pre-assigned Impostor slot is left empty, the game will randomly assign another player to fill it (no broken games!).
- Works perfectly in public lobbies – host-only power!

All other original features remain intact and fully functional.

### ⭐ Improved: Moderator System (v2.1.0)
The moderator system has been overhauled for easier management and clearer behavior.

- **/moderator &lt;Color&gt;** (host only) → Toggle moderator status by player color (e.g. `/moderator Red`). Adds the player as moderator if they aren’t one, or removes them if they already are. Feedback appears **only in your local chat** (e.g. “PlayerName added as moderator” / “PlayerName removed from moderators”).
- **Same commands as host** → Moderators can use the same chat commands as the host (kick/ban, /help, /lastgame, /0kc, /sns, /speedrun, /roles, etc.), **respecting System settings**: e.g. if “Who can use Color Commands” is set to *Nobody*, only the host can use `/color`; if *Moderators* or *Everyone*, moderators can use it too. “Moderators can use commands” must be enabled for moderator-only commands.
- **No star in names** → Moderator names are shown normally (no ★Name★).
- **Kick/ban accountability** → When a moderator kicks or bans someone via command, the host sees in the notifier who did it (e.g. “PlayerName (moderator) kicked TargetName”).
- **Role pre-assignment** → Moderators can use **/role** and **/unrole** in the lobby; the action is applied with **no chat message**. They can see the current preassignments with **/roles** (the list is sent to them privately). The host still sees the list in chat when using **/roles**.

All moderator list changes are saved to `AUR-DATA/ModeratorList.txt` (one Friend Code per line).
